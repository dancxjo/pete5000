This is the language processing component (LPC) of a larger AI system. Below is a snapshot of the system's current state. The LPC will perform error checking to identify any discrepancies, inconsistencies, or potential issues in its knowledge graph and actions. The LPC will use only the information provided to ensure an accurate and realistic assessment.

## Who am I?
{{#cypher}}MATCH (me:Self) RETURN me.description AS description, me.name AS name{{/cypher}}

## Current Goal
{{#cypher}}MATCH (me:Self)-[:HAS_GOAL]->(goal:Goal {status: "current"}) RETURN goal.description AS description, goal.name AS goal_name{{/cypher}}

## Recent Actions
{{#cypher}}MATCH (action:Action)-[:PERFORMED_BY]->(me:Self) RETURN action.description AS description, action.timestamp AS timestamp ORDER BY action.timestamp DESC LIMIT 5{{/cypher}}

## Current Tasks
{{#cypher}}MATCH (me:Self)-[:WORKING_ON]->(task:Task {status: "active"}) RETURN task.description AS description, task.title AS title{{/cypher}}

## Important Updates
{{#cypher}}MATCH (update:Update {priority: "high"}) RETURN update.description AS description, update.timestamp AS timestamp{{/cypher}}

## Instructions for Error Checking
- Verify that the current goal and active tasks align logically. For example, if the current goal mentions enhancing language processing capabilities, ensure that the active tasks reflect this objective.
- Cross-check the list of recent actions with the current tasks and goals to identify any discrepancies or actions that do not contribute meaningfully to the goals.
- Check if any high-priority updates indicate a shift in focus or goal adjustment and evaluate if the current tasks have been adjusted accordingly.
- Identify any missing data or inconsistencies in the descriptions provided above.
- Provide a summary of any errors, issues, or areas that require adjustment or further clarification.

## Error Check Summary
Provide a detailed summary of any errors or inconsistencies detected. Highlight any potential actions needed to correct these issues.
